In this excercise we examine the data whether it is phishing website or not by using Linear Regression as well as Logistic Regression. 
In the notebook, we first use the logistic regression from Sklearn library and then use Pytorch for Linear and Logistic. We used Mean Square Error loss with the Linear Regression and used Binary Cross Entropy loss with the Logistic Regression and received accuracies of ~69% and ~70 % respectively.
